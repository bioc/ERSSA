\title{Plot number of DE genes}
\usage{
ggplot2_dotplot(deg = NULL, path = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{deg}{The list of DE genes generated by one of ERSSA::DE_*.R scripts.}

\item{path}{Path to which the plot will be saved. Default to current working directory.}
}
\value{
A list is returned containing:
 \itemize{
  \item{gg_object} {the ggplot2 object, which can then be further customized.}
  \item{deg_dataframe} {the tidy table version of DEG number for plotting.}
  \item{full_num_DEG} {The number of DE genes with all samples included.}
}
}
\description{
\code{ggplot2_dotplot} function plots the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes in each test.
}
\details{
The number of DE genes are plotted as dots grouped by the associated
replicate level. At each replicate level, a boxplot is drawn to mainly show
the first and third quartiles as well as the median. Additionally,
A red line is drawn representing the mean at each replicate level. A horizontal
dashed blue line represents the number of DE genes found with all samples.
}
\examples{
#load edgeR deg object generated by erssa_edger using example dataset
data(deg, package = "ERSSA")
gg_dot = ggplot2_dotplot(deg)
