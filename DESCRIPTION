Version: 0.0.1

Author: Zach Shao [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Zach Shao <Zixuanshao.zach@gmail.com>
Description: The ERSSA package takes user supplied RNA-seq differential expression 
	dataset and calculates the number of differentially expressed genes at varying 
	biological replicate number. This allows the user to determine, without providing
	any prior assumption, whether sufficient differential detection has been acheived 
	with their RNA-seq dataset.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.3)
